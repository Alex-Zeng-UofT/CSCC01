# Week 2 Notes #

## Separating the Problem fom the Solution ##

A separate problem description is useful
- it can be dicussed with stakeholders
- it can be used to evaluate design choices
- it is a good source of test cases

Still need to check
- solution correctly solves the stated problem (verification)
- problem statement corresponds to the needs od the stakeholders (validation)

## Stakeholders ##

Identity all the poeple who must be consulted during information acquisition

Stakeholders include:
- users
- customers
- business analysts/marketing team
- training and user support staff
- technical authors
- designers
- project manager

## Identifyingg Stakeholders' Goals

Approach:
- focus on why a systems is required
- express the "why" as a set of stakeholder goals
- use goal refinement to arrive at specific requirements
- Goal analysis: document, organize and classify goals
- Goal evolution: refine, elaborate, and operationalize goals
- Goal hierarchies show refinements and alternatives

Advantages:
- reasonably intuitive
- explicit declaration of goals provides sound basis for conflict resoultion

Disadvantages:
- captures a static picture
- can regress forever up or down the goal hierarchy

**Soft Goals**: subjective and vauge goals that may be hard to objectively assess and strategize. Soft goals can be used as Selection Criteria at a higher level.

##From Requirements to Design

1. Identify the problem
  - Identifying actors
    - Primary actors: daily users/customers
    - Secondary actors: IT guy
  - Use personas
    - Detailed description of user characteristics, goals, and preferences
    - Enhances UCD and UX while facilitating communication with development team
    

2. Scope the problem

3. Identify solution scenarios

4. Map onto the architecture
